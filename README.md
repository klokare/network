network

Comparing neural network implementations for **evo**. This is a playground of sorts that helps me compare different network types and implementations for performance and memory usage.

Types of networks included
* Layered - feed-forward networks where data flows from one layer directly into, and only into, the next layer
* Forward - feed-forward networks where incoming connections can come from any neuron ordered before the current one
* Recurrent - a network in which connections can be made backwards to earlier neurons or to self
